This is a Full Stack Application Project:

Develop a full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions regarding the content of these documents. 
The backend will process these documents and utilize natural language processing to provide answers to the questions posed by the users.


Tools and Technologies:
Backend: FastAPI
NLP Processing: LangChain/LLamaIndex
Frontend: React.js
Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL (for storing document metadata, if necessary)
File Storage: Local filesystem or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for storing uploaded PDFs

Functionalities:
PDF Upload:
Users can upload PDF documents to the application.
The application stores the PDF and possibly extracts and stores its text content for further processing.
Asking Questions:
Users can ask questions related to the content of an uploaded PDF.
The system processes the question and the content of the PDF to provide an answer.
Displaying Answers:
The application displays the answer to the userâ€™s question.
Include the functionality to ask follow-up or new questions on the same document.
